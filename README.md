# Prime-Number-
I have four different prime numbers all under 1000.
I have noticed that the product of these primes is a twelve-digit number whose digits are either
sequential in ascending order or the same as the previous digit so:
111233456678
is valid however:
113445566777
998876554321
112344556567
Are not.
What are the four prime numbers?
