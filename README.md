# Prime-Number-
I have four different prime numbers all under 1000.
<br /> 
I have noticed that the product of these primes is a twelve-digit number whose digits are either
<br /> 
sequential in ascending order or the same as the previous digit so:
<br /> 
111233456678
<br /> 
is valid however:
<br /> 
113445566777
<br /> 
998876554321
<br /> 
112344556567
<br /> 
Are not.
<br /> 
What are the four prime numbers?
